My Youtube Channel with 0ad mods scenario videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ_3FPQgTq5b66esOQ_bPnA

Here some scenarios I've created:

#1- Scenarios
## 1.1- Noronha
Before the conquer of America, in 0A.D., some civilization came to Noronha in the way to the land. They setted there and soon found that island as a small place for everybody.

## 1.2- Rio
After Noronha, they came to Rio. In this place, their ambitions succumbed to natural threats. Bones can tell us the history.

## 1.3- Eye of Africa
In the west of the Sahara desert there's a sacred place. The big Eye of Africa. It hides mistery and histories. Some say is the home of Mumm-Ra, the everliving.

## 1.4- Hunga Tonga Island
In 0A.D. Hunga, a Tonga archipelago island was an active volcano. The island design was a little familiar with the one we have today. But today it has changed again and again. This island is always next to explode.

## 1.5- Napata War
Original Napata War scenario from the 0A.D. game is alpha 25 version modified.
Introduced some civilizations into the scenario. Modified the Jebel Barcal montain making it accessible from the ground.

## 1.6- Napata Island
Somewhere in time, Jebel Barcal montain turned into an island in a big ocean created by the unstopable rain. When dry days came the water started to decrease its level and the scenario turned big and desert.
